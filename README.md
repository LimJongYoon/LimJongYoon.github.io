##### Force-Feedback Haptic Device for Representation of Tugs in Virtual Reality

Electronics 11 (11), 1730

This study proposes and evaluates a force-feedback haptic device, HapTug, designed to replicate the sensation of tool usage in virtual reality (VR) environments. The device is connected to a VR bundle controller and simulates the centrifugal forces and reactive forces felt by the user when swinging or thrusting a tool, providing a more realistic haptic feedback experience.
Background:
* Need for Force-Feedback Haptic Devices: Traditional VR bundle controllers use limited vibration motors to implement haptic feedback, which is insufficient for enhancing realism, especially in VR simulations that involve tool usage. Stronger and more precise haptic feedback is necessary in these scenarios.
* Objective: HapTug aims to increase realism and immersion in VR by replicating the inertia or centrifugal force felt when users swing tools and the reactive force experienced when tools make contact with objects in the virtual environment.
Device Design:
* Mechanical Structure: HapTug is designed with 2 degrees of freedom (2DoF) to provide the pushing and pulling forces based on the user's wrist movements. This allows users to experience the physical forces encountered in various tool usage scenarios.
* Control System: The device is controlled by two 6V servo motors, which automatically adjust the controller's position based on user movements. It connects to the Oculus Quest 2 HMD via an Arduino-based control system.
Methods and Results:
* Experiment 1: Initial Testing: Eight participants were tested using HapTug to evaluate the force felt when swinging or thrusting tools in a VR environment. The results confirmed that users could perceive realistic tool usage sensations.
* Experiment 2: User Experience Evaluation: Thirty participants compared HapTug with a standard VR controller, evaluating realism, immersion, and enjoyment. Scores were significantly higher in all categories when using HapTug.
* Experiment 3: Interaction Evaluation: Forty-one participants were assessed for the range and frequency of interactions with and without HapTug. The results showed that HapTug increased the range and frequency of interactions, leading to deeper user immersion.
Conclusions and Implications:
HapTug has been proven to significantly enhance haptic feedback in VR environments, greatly improving user experience. It is particularly effective in providing realistic force feedback during tool usage, thereby increasing user immersion. However, improvements are needed in areas such as battery consumption, adjustment for different hand sizes, and wearing comfort. Addressing these issues could greatly expand HapTug's applicability in various fields such as healthcare, industry, and education.
Contribution of the Study:
This research makes a significant contribution to the advancement of VR technology and the enhancement of user experience by designing and empirically evaluating a force-feedback haptic device that more realistically simulates the sensation of tool usage in VR environments.

##### BirdVR :UX design that enhances the connection between the form of the VR controller and the interaction within the content

HCI 2022 Creative Award Proceeding(Conference Paper) / Interactive Art Gallery

The BirdVR project is a UI/UX design study focused on creating a bird-shaped VR controller specifically for seniors over 65 years old. The goal is to help this demographic easily learn and operate VR content without compromising their sense of immersion.
Key Problems Addressed:
1. Difficulty with Traditional Controllers: Seniors often find it challenging to use standard VR controllers.
2. Disrupted Immersion: Complex interactive functions in VR content can disturb the sense of stability and immersion for elderly users.
Solutions and Features:
* Bird-Shaped Controller: The controller is designed to resemble a bird, providing two main benefits:
    * Ease of Learning: The bird-like form aligns with the VR environment, making the interface intuitive for seniors.
    * Psychological Stability: The act of petting the bird-shaped controller mimics the soothing experience of interacting with a real bird, contributing to a sense of psychological comfort.
* Interactive Touch Areas: The controller is wrapped with conductive thread, allowing different game functions to be triggered based on where the user touches. This feature enhances interactivity while keeping the experience simple.
* Removed Motorized Wings: Although initially designed with motorized wings, they were removed after feedback indicated they detracted from the experience.
Application:
* The BirdVR controller is currently in use at a welfare center in Gogang-dong, Seoul, where it helps seniors engage with psychological healing VR content.
Recognition:
* The project was presented as part of the HCI Korea 2022 Creative Award and is documented in the Interactive Art Gallery.
