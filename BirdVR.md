        The BirdVR project is a UI/UX design initiative aimed at developing a bird-shaped VR controller tailored specifically for seniors aged 65 and older. This project addresses two key challenges: the difficulty seniors experience with traditional VR controllers and the disruption of immersion caused by complex interactive functions. The BirdVR controller offers an innovative solution by adopting a bird-like form, which serves dual purposes: it simplifies the learning process by aligning with the VR environment and enhances psychological stability through the soothing experience of petting the bird-shaped device. The controller is equipped with interactive touch areas, made possible by conductive thread, allowing for intuitive and simplified interaction within VR environments. Based on user feedback, motorized wings initially integrated into the design were removed to preserve the simplicity and comfort of the experience. The BirdVR controller is currently implemented at a welfare center in Gogang-dong, Seoul, where it is utilized in psychological healing VR content for seniors. The project has been recognized at HCI Korea 2022, where it was featured in the Interactive Art Gallery as part of the Creative Award showcase.
